# bash-code-project18-openPort
Made a bash script to check available ports 

I used lsof command to make htis script, however you can adapt it using netstat or anything you prefer.
used lsof because it is avvailable on launch of any Ubuntu distro

As usual installation is simple, clone the repo, go into the folder and change the permissions of the script chmod +x openPort

Warnings
-------------
Script runs with sudo
